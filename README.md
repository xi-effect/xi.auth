# xi.auth
Old backend for user-related services for xi.effect. Started on July 10th, 2023 as a new and fresh microservice to start the gradual switch from the previous monolith, [xi.backend](https://github.com/xi-effect/xi.backend). Allowed the company to switch to FastAPI, async SQLAlchemy, AIOGram, Pytest-AnyIO and many other new technologies & development processes. On June 19th, 2025 the functionality has been merged into the new monorepository ([xi.back-2](https://github.com/xi-effect/xi.back-2)) in [PR#50](https://github.com/xi-effect/xi.back-2/pull/50), so on July 10th, 2025 the repository will be archived
